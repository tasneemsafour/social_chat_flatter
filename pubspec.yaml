  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Signatra
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fontss/Signatra.ttf
    - family: Pacifico-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Pacifico-Regular.ttf
    - family: SourceSansPro-Regular
      fonts:
          asset: fonts/SourceSansPro-Regular.ttf
  assets:
    - assets/images/google_signin_button.png
    - assets/images/upload.svg

    - assets/images/no_content.svg
